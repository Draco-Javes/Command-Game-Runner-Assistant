Tom
An abnormally long and lanky black tabby cat with eyes that resemble a starry night sky painted by the blue streaks of meteors. He has a very long tail that complements the length of his body. Strangely, this tail is almost completely white, suggesting pigment loss due to high levels of stress. Going back to the eyes, though they are vivid, they are soulless, reflecting Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosissupercalifragilisticexpialidociousabsolutelyincomprehensiblefloccinaucinihilipilificationthisisrevengeformelasandiwillalsogivethiscatareallylongdescriptionbecauseyoudeservethatstripe's waning desire to continue living on this plane, for a greater form awaits him when he leaves this silly mortal life.
